    ```
- [ ] Create a new repository on gitHub: https://github.com/new

    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] ☕ Now that the base is in place Treat yourself to a cup of tea.

#### Start

    git commit "<text>"
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] ☕ Now that the first code is up, take some time for Tea again and write down your next steps here in the TODO file.
- [ ] 

#### The Finish

- [ ] Run the code for the final test
- [ ] If the code does what it is supposed to do, do another push into git and go into finishing.

    git add .
    git commit "Finel Test is over!"
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] Delete all folders and files you no longer need.
